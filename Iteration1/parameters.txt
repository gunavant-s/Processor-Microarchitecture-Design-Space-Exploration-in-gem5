localPredictorSize: This is the "memory" for predicting direction. It uses this history to make a guess (the prediction result) about IF the branch will be taken.
                    It sets the number of 2-bit counters used to guess IF a branch will be taken (Yes/No). 
                    A size of 1024 means it can track the specific history for 1024 different branches.

BTBEntries:         This is the "address book" for predicting the target. This is the result of a previous branch calculation, telling the CPU WHERE to jump.
                    It sets the number of slots available to store WHERE a branch will jump to. A size of 512 means it can "remember" the target addresses for 512 different branches.

Tagsize:            This is the "ID check" for the BTB. It's the number of bits used to CONFIRM that the branch at a certain address is the same one stored in the BTB. 
                    A larger tag reduces the chance of mistaking one branch for another (aliasing).
